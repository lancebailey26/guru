## Product

</center>

* [Guru Gainz](link) was born out of an idea after noticing a trend with both YouTubers and Instagram influencers - they rarely interact with their communities in ways that truly benefit those initiating the interactions. Instead, oftentimes those "responded" to are merely chosen and highlighted in order to bolster the influencer's image. We saught to create a level playing field. We created a platform where both fitness influencers and fitness newbies can join together as one in order to talk about their fitness goals.

## Solution

</center>

* Our solution was creating a vitual space where both influencer and the influenced can interact with one another as equals. We accomplished this by creating an open journal of those who wish to share their fitness gains for everyone in the community to see. The application also provides tailor-made routines made for the user in order to boost their gains even further.

## Concept

</center>

* The user creates a login profile by providing an email address and a password.
*  The user is then directed to the home page, where they can select from three options - posting an update, seeing pre-made routines, and the user's profile.
* When the user posts an update, they can broadcast an update of their fitness goals to the page.
* When the user goes to their "For You Page", they are presented with a workout routine that they can incorporate into their routine for that day.
* When the user goes to their profile, they can review their posts made.

As a group, we believe that fitness entheusiasts looking to meet their fitness goals should be able to achieve them while being treated as equals by influential fitness gurus.
